Introduction
============

This program attempts to analyze a series of 8-ball Billards game results and
extract relative player statistics from the data.  In the future, I'd like to
have the program team pairings to have even match-ups in team 8-ball.

Running the samples
===================

 1. Install the needed dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 2. Run the analyzer with the sample `bin/analyze -p samples/2-player.json`
